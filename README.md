## Mechanics
- Enemy cards trigger individual alarm countdowns on reveal. Match the same two enemy cards to clear all alarm countdowns!
- Alarms not cleared will deal damage when time runs out.
- Allies will provide health boosts when matched.
- Incorrect matches will decrement the boss attack countdown. If it runs out, Snake will be reduced to 1 HP and lose 1 maximum HP.
- If Snake loses all his health then it's Game Over!
